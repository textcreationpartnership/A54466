            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing very late laſt night before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to my Lodgings, as I paſt by the Groom-Porters, the Chair-men ask'd me, if I would not have a Chair? I told them, I could not afford it. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was paſſing by took occaſion to ſay, I might have a Chair for a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I ask'd him how much? He ſaid, they never took leſs than a Shilling, tho it was but to the next door, and yet I might be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37224:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 46 -->carried from thenee to <hi>White-hall</hi> for the ſame Money: But continuing to ſay that I could not afford to pay for a Chair, he took the liberty to expreſs himſelf very much againſt the Times and the Government, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that all true Chriſtians were oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and under a ſevere Perſecution. I ask'd him how this could be, ſince the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment did allow Liberty of Conſcience to all Religions and Perſwaſions? And tho I could not by this time but give a ſhrewd gueſs what Judgment and Perſwaſion he was of, yet that I might be ſure not to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, nor to ſeem too ſenſible of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſeem'd ignorant, and inſtanced in the chief, and moſt known Diſſenters, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Anabaptiſts, Independants, and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians; ſaying that Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was allow'd to theſe and all others, and how then could any complain of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution? True, ſays he, Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is granted to theſe and all others who do own the Authority of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but there is none allowed to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37224:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 46 -->thoſe who are perſwaded in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that King <hi>James</hi> is the Lawful King, and that this Government is no other than an Uſurpation. Why, ſaid I, would you have the Government tolerate its own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? and pray is not King <hi>William</hi>'s Title to this Government, as good as <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s was to that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, upon the ſight of his Coin, that Tribute ſhould be paid to him? And I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, if we may pay <hi>Caeſar</hi> Tribute, we may Obey him, and if Obey him why not Pray for him? No, ſays he, our caſe and that of the <hi>Jews</hi> is very different; by the Word <hi>Caeſar</hi> can be underſtood no more than the King, and ſo, if in our Common-Prayer Books there had been no expreſs mention of King <hi>William,</hi> in excluſion of King <hi>James,</hi> we cou'd have pray'd for the King. I anſwer'd, if by <hi>Caeſar</hi> our Saviour did underſtand the Perſon of that <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was then the Supreme Governour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as appears from the Nature, and Force of his argument, taken from the ſight
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37224:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->of his Image, and Superſcription upon his Coin, as alſo from his willingneſs to ſuffer under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> his Deputy, and his owning his Power and Authority to come from God, then it is manifeſt that the caſe is the ſame. And that he might not have the leaſt apprehenſion of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s having a better Title to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> than his preſent Majeſty to this Government, I told him that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Determination ſo much in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Favour, it was elſewhere evident that our Saviour did work a Miracle to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to that Power, and Authority, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had put out of poſſeſſion; for did he not command <hi>Peter</hi> to caſt a Hook into the Sea, and to give that Money to the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians of the Temple, which he ſhould find in the Fiſhes mouth? And in aſmuch as this Tribute was not paid to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but to the Temple, we may, with good reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it had not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s but the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Image and Superſcription upon it. Being able to make no Reply to this Argument, I took occaſion thus to explain my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37224:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->paying Tribute and Obedience to King <hi>William,</hi> ſaying, by the ſame rule any one ſhall think it a ſin to do, or ſay any thing that is an Acknowledgment of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he ought not to Receive, pay, or trade with any of his Coin, that ſhall have his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Superſcription upon it, and that whoever does do it ought to own his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and in effect does acknowledge it. I urged this conſideration ſo far, as to ſay, you ought not with his Money ſo much as to buy a piece of Bread, if you deny his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Why then, ſays he, we muſt ſtarve; yes, ſaid I, you muſt, and ought to ſtarve, rather than do any thing that is contrary to what you are perſwaded in your Minds to be the Truth, or is inconſiſtent with that Perſwaſion. But then, I added, this cannot happen to any that are willing to do as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, who by their Virtues and Graces ſo recommended themſelves to the Charity and Good will of others, that they did not want Food and Rayment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them. Nor ought you to doubt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37224:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->but God, if your Cauſe and Virtues be good and great, will Bleſs and reward you in this or the next World, in propotion to the goodneſs of your Cauſe, and the greatneſs of your Virtues, as he always does thoſe who worſhip him in ſincerity and truth, and do lay down their Lives for the faith. To theſe things he anſwered only in a General and confuſed manner, without any chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, ſaying the Times the Times were not now like thoſe in the Apoſtles days, and that as this Government had not, ſo nor could it maintain its Authority, by any Doctrines of Reaſon and Juſtice, and ſo it ought not to be acknowledged, and ſubmitted to. By this time, after ſeveral haltings by the way, we were come as far as the Horſe Guards, and now perceiving in the Gentleman no more of that evenneſs and calmneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which had at firſt engag'd me to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his complaints, I told him I muſt bid him Good Night, for my Lodgings lay the other way in the <hi>Strand.</hi> When he perceiv'd he had drawn me out of my way, he civilly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37224:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->askt my pardon, and ſo we parted. Coming to my Inn, and reflecting upon this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with all the calmneſs and ſedateneſs that I could, I could not but chide my ſelf, that I had not brought him to my Inn, or enquired of him his Habitation, that ſo I might at another opportunity, have given him further ſatisfaction in theſe things. For tho, as I ſaid, his temper at laſt ſeem'd to be diſturbed and uneaſy, and ſuch as did even make me ſuſpicious, leſt he ſhould have ſome deſign to draw me into inconveniencies, yet I could not but remember, that about the middle of our Diſcourſe (when I had preſs'd him with ſome, as I thought very plain and eaſy Arguments for a peaceable ſubmiſſion to the preſent Government) he ſeemed to be convinced, and told me in a very modeſt, and humble manner (without as I thought all Art and Diſguiſe) he ſhould be glad to wait upon me, if I would give him leave, at my Lodging, or where I ſhould appoint, for further ſatisfaction in a caſe that had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſo much troubled his Mind. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37224:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->truly, I think, I was not ſo ſenſible as I ought, or I had comply'd with his Deſire. Nor could it be any thing but Weakneſs and Fear, that made me decline ſo affable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, and acknowledgment. And poſſibly ſo unexpected a diſappointment from one of my profeſſion, (who upon all occaſions ought to inform and ſtrengthen the minds of the wavering and doubtful) did ſo trouble and diſcompoſe his ſpirits, that he could not afterwards maintain that ſedateneſs, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which before had been ſo inviting. Nor did theſe my weak and feeble jealouſies fail to work the like effects in my own Breaſt; ſo that our diſcourſe about anothers Title to the Soveraignty of a Nation, was concluded in a mutual abdication of that Soveraignty of Reaſon and Virtue, which ought to baniſh all thoſe ſervile fears, and ſlaviſh ſuſpicions, which ſo much diſſipate all the Obligations of a generous Love, and Charity, to Friends and Enemies, that we cannot do thoſe things which Virtue and Religion would elſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to. Thus, Sir, for want of other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37224:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->imployment, at this time, preſuming upon the greatneſs and freedom of our friendſhip, I have thought fit for your Diverſion, to lay before you this laſt Nights adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I know very well this way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Reaſoning, with this ſort of Men is not approved of by many that are right well affected to the preſent Government, for that they do conceive it is not built upon a good Foundation; and when I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times urged them with the Authority of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> concerning our Saviours working a Miracle to pay Tribute to the Temple, as you may find it in the latter part of his 17th Chapter, and which I have here alluded to, ſaying, that the Precepts and Practice of our Saviour, cannot but be built upon a good Foundation, they have deny'd the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I put upon that place: But knowing that I have the Authority of many Learned Men, and that the Text does naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this explication, and no other, I do not doubt but I ſhall be able to juſtify this method of Reaſoning with our proſecuted

               <!-- PDF PAGE 50 -->Diſſenters; and as by former experience I have obſerved it to ſhake the height of their Confidence and Aſſurance, ſo I doubt not but I ſhall do a good piece of ſervice for the intereſt of Truth, and the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Mens Conſciences, if I can, as I believe I can, make it evident, that as no Government will be ſo witleſs as to tolerate their profeſt Enemies, and thoſe that diſown their Authority; ſo all true Chriſtians ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
